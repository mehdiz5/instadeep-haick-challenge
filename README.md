## Challenge
Decoding Protein Functionality: A Challenge to Predict Gene Ontology from Protein Sequence Data

## Competition description
The study of protein function has become a crucial issue in recent years due to proteins' vital role in biological processes. However, in vivo and in vitro experimental strategies are often time-consuming and labor-intensive, and there is a need for a prediction tool to predict functional proteins. Although 70 million protein sequences are available, only 1% of their gene functions are known. The Gene Ontology database, with its hierarchical structure, is widely used for protein function annotation. In this challenge, we ask you to build a model that predicts the gene ontology class “Cellular Component (CC), Molecular Function (MF), and Biological Process (BP)” from a given protein sequence alone.
